This is a little script I did to screencapture sole tutorials.
Basically it is a mixture of two scripts:
- first one is from metalx1000
- second is from AutoStatic

REQUREMENTS:
- you will need 'xwininfo' installed
- ffmpeg has to be compiled with 'jack'

CHECKING FFMPEG with JACK:
to check if ffmpeg is compiled with jack simply run in your terminal:
$ ffmpeg -formats | grep jack

an output should apear like this:
D  jack    JACK Audio Connection Kit


RUNNING the script:
1) Simply drop the script to a folder where you want to store the video
2) start jack with f.e. QJackCtl
3) run the script from shell, it will prompt for a filename
4) use the little x that appears to choose the window you want to capture or the desctop for fullscreen
5) connect the outputs of the apps you use to the input "ffmpeg" and "system"

to end the script simply use <CTRL> - <C>
you now can author the video with any videoeditor you like

btw: I take no warrenty for this script ;) 
 
have fun
